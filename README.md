# py_rinex_reader

A crude RINEX file reader. By no means the work of a professional but mearly a student giving his best.
This programm was tested with the included RINEX file (version 3.02) but i want to test other (newer) 
vesions too. It wont catch errors yet but that could change in the near future. 

# ToDo
* JSON output file
* GUI with some sort of interaction
    * Load different RINEX file?
    * DIsplay metadata of choosen file?
    
* Use of dictionaries
* JSON dump
* Clean up header reading code  
* ???
